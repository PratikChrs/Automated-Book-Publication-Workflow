# ðŸ“š Automated Book Publication Workflow using AI Agents

This project implements an **agentic AI-powered system** that fetches literary content from a web URL, rewrites it in a modern storytelling style using LLMs, allows human review and editing, and stores every version with intelligent search and retrieval.

## ðŸš€ Features

### âœ… Key Capabilities
1. **Scraping & Screenshot**  
   Scrapes chapters from literary sources like Wikisource and captures full-page screenshots using **Playwright**.

2. **AI Writing & Review**  
   Uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to rewrite old-style literature into modern, vivid storytelling while preserving meaning and emotional clarity.

3. **Human-in-the-Loop Editing**  
   Allows users to accept or manually refine AI-spun chapters. Edits are saved and versioned.

4. **Agentic API Design**  
   Modular agent-based structure for Scraper, AI Writer, Editor, Versioner, and Retriever for seamless flow.

5. **Versioning & Consistency with ChromaDB**  
   Stores every final/edited version with metadata. Enables semantic search and intelligent retrieval using RL-style ranking.
